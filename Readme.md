Author: TriggerAu

####About
Basically the Alternate Resource panel displays a view of resources in the current vessel with a bit more clarity. It also lets you see the remaining values in the currently active stage for fuels as you fly - which is useful for asparagus staging.

It also has some Staging capabilities added so you can stage from map view and also have autostaging on ascent (tied it in because of the resources/last stage tie in)

####Downloads
You can find a full list of all the released versions and their associated KSP version in the [GitHub Releases for the project](https://github.com/TriggerAu/AlternateResourcePanel/releases)
